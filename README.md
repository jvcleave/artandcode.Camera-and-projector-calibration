Beware that is fork is incomplete.
I did a lot of addon butchering in order to get it CalibrateProjector to compile for a Mac/OF 007 so hopefully this can  
help someone looking to do the same. - Jason





# 4A: Calibrating Projectors and Cameras: Practical Tools
*Sunday October 23, Workshop Room TBD @ 10:45a - 12:45pm*

http://artandcode.com/3d/workshops/4a-calibrating-projectors-and-cameras

## Presented by
* Elliot Woods (http://www.kimchiandchips.com)
* Kyle McDonald (http://kylemcdonald.net/)

## Overview
Enclosed are openFrameworks examples which demonstrate the principles of the workshop.
These examples are designed to work as practical tools for others to begin working with calibrating cameras and projectors.

## Platform
These examples are generated on a range of platforms. Generally:

* OSX, XCode 4
* openFrameworks 007 [*]
* ofxCv (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv.git)
* ofxCvGui (https://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxCVgui)
* ofxKinect (unsure which fork/branch at present)
* ofxOpenNI2
	*further install instructions for OpenNI on osx at http://kinecthesis.bakedmac.com/2011/01/11/installing-openni-kinect-drivers-and-nite-on-mac-os-x-10-6/)
* ofxTalky (+ofxNetwork)

(* Note: sometimes examples may be built against the current github release at the time of creation. In these cases we should go back and edit the examples so they build/execute properly against the stable distribution available on website download).

Some specific projects may require other dependencies e.g.

* ofxPolyfit (https://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxPolyfit)
* Simple GUI
